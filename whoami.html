            <p class="description"> Hi everyone, I'm John Doe and that's my story:

                Born in Mantua in 1988, I relocated to New York to pursue architecture studies at Columbia University,
                where I graduated in Architectural Design in 2015. From the early years of university, I became
                interested in photography, a passion I cultivated alongside art and design. These overlapping interests
                fueled my creative pursuits throughout my studies. Upon returning to my hometown, I began collaborating
                with a design studio and embarked on a career as a photographer.

                I initially discovered photography as a tool for understanding my surroundings. My personal projects are
                interpretations of urban contexts in both Italy and abroad, aiming to find a formal synthesis of the
                city through its objects: Understanding and Expression. My skills acquired during my architectural
                studies and technical knowledge gained through my passion form the foundation of my professional work
                for design studios and private clients.</p>
